### DSC Review Session Two
- Split into an object oriented programming crash course and review requests
- Prerequisites: methods, conditionals, loops, arrays (functional programming basics)
- Goal: get everyone to a point they can focus on problem solving instead of stumbling over oop (or at least to a point where they can study on their own without backtracking too much)
- If you feel confident with lab ten and assignment four, this session will likely be beneath you
